\section{Introduction} In this assignment we were to produce two part solution
that estimates a robot's position on some grid by only using the output of a
noisy sensor. The two parts thus consist of a simulation of the robot and the
sensor as well as the algorithm that estimates the robot's position.

\section{Running Instructions} The .java files containing the classes described
above are located in a package called othello placed on
/h/d9/v/dat11fp1/TAI/probabilistic\_reasoning on the student computer system. It
is simply to compile the java files in the package and then run *******Main from
outside that package. For example if the current directory is
/h/d9/v/dat11fp1/TAI the following command will compile the files: \texttt{javac
probabilistic\_reasoning/*.java}. After compiling the program can be run with
the following command: \texttt{java probabilistic\_reasoning.*****Main}.
